### Why Philosophy?
The following will be a deep dive into the realm of Philosophy. The curious adolescent minds of students are often intrigued by the endless void that is philosophy. From the abstract (but logical) language games of Wittgenstein to the rigorous logic and wittiness of his mentor Bertrand Russell. From the ambitious ethical duties of Immanuel Kant to the computational proxies of Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill (and perhaps beyond good and evil with Friedrich Nietzsche). Perhaps one is going through an existential crisis and seek refuge in the works of Albert Camus or Sartre. Perhaps one turns to the stoics for inspirational quotes to scribble on the wall of one’s start-up garage-office while micro-dosing LSD, honing the art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and filming a-day-in-the-life-of-an-entrepreneur for one’s YouTube channel. Whatever the reason may be, one thing remains a challenge for one’s philosophical endeavors: time – hence why philosophy is a void. The endless hours needed to get a decent overview of all of philosophy exceeds one human life, perhaps even hundreds (maybe thousands). Consequently, with the help of Wikipedia, some network theory, and some computational semantics we strive to create just that. The project revolves around creating a network of Philosophy using data from Wikipedia.

### How data is gathered
The data is gathered using the Python wrapper for Wikipedia’s API, _Wikipedia-API_. Using a list of philosophers, _Lists of philosophers by name_ provided by Wikipedia (found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_philosophers) data was extracted from each philosopher's Wikipedia page: content (text), links (outgoing Wikipedia hyperlinks) and info box. These were used to create the initial graph.
